### GEE data download tool

This project is used for download GEE data. You must first install `GEE` and `requests` lib to start using it.

There are still so many functions without docstring, but I believe it's no need to use anyone of them if you just want to download some data.

There is a completed example in `main.py`, you can follow it to build your download code.

You can use
```
pip install requests
```
to install the requirements.
